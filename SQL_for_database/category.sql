INSERT INTO `category` VALUES (1, 'Data Preproceccing', 'Data preprocessing is a data mining technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable format. Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and is likely to contain many errors. Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues.');
INSERT INTO `category` VALUES (2, 'Loss Function', 'In mathematical optimization, statistics, econometrics, decision theory, machine learning and computational neuroscience, a loss function or cost function is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some \"cost\" associated with the event. An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function. An objective function is either a loss function or its negative (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc.), in which case it is to be maximized.');
INSERT INTO `category` VALUES (3, 'Supervised Learning', 'Supervised learning is the Data mining task of inferring a function from labeled training data.The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called thesupervisory signal).');
INSERT INTO `category` VALUES (4, 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Unsupervised Learning is a class of Machine Learning techniques to find the patterns in data. The data given to unsupervised algorithm are not labelled, which means only the input variables(X) are given with no corresponding output variables.');
INSERT INTO `category` VALUES (5, 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. Reinforcement. It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation.');
INSERT INTO `category` VALUES (6, 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.');
